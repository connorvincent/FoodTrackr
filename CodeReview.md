# Code Review For Group 1
## __**09/11/17**__

### Greetings! I will be assisting you and your program as you progress through the semester. 

* Code reviews support the Agile Process. It helps maintain working software, improves collaboration and interaction among team members, 
  and helps deliver overall better programs.

* I will check in periodically to see how your program is going, and provide any insights if I have them.

* The earlier you get started, the higher the odds that you will complete your program.

* Push up an outline of what the vision is for the program. This will help you and your
  team members move towards a single endpoint, and help flush concepts and issues out early. Also, it will help me know what direction your team is going while I am reading your code.

* Branch off of master before working on a new feature. This will make adding everyone's features into a the master branch easier,
  and will keep your master branch's code clean. Branch first, commit often, and merge master into your local branch to test it
  before merging your branch into master.
  
* Overall, it looks like a great start!
